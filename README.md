# Random Words
Program to generate random adjective-noun pairs from two user-chosen lists.

Simple GUI with popups to choose list files, and button to get a new prompt. Adjective and noun lists are read as lines from text files. File locations and window size are stored as user preferences to persist over closing and re-opening the program.

Made for my brother as a challenge in three hours.
